<p>Having decided to live a minimalist lifestyle, the foremost thing to do is to screen yourself inwards.

Having a self-assessment will be the foundation of your journey to simplicity. It opens your mind as to who and what stays, goes, or deserves your time. It is a fact-finding mission.

According to Socrates, self-discovery is the first step in actualizing anything. In his quote, “Man know thyself.” the philosopher explained that “an unexamined life is not worth living.”

That means you have to do an inventory of what your life is like by asking yourself hard questions about the things you do, the places you go to, and how your time and money is being spent.</p>

A good example is when you calculate the amount of time and money you spend surfing irrelevant social media platforms and websites. This assessment will open your eyes to the myriad of other meaningful things you can do with less time and money.</p>
